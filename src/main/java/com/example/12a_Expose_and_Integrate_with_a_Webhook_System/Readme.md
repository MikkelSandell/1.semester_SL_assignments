üéüÔ∏è TicketMaster Webhook Receiver
A simple Express app to receive webhook events for testing TicketMaster integrations.

üì¶ Requirements
Node.js

express (npm install express)

localtunnel (npm install -g localtunnel)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup
you wil need a project like this
javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post("/ticketwebhookjson", (req, res) => {
    console.log('üéüÔ∏è Webhook received:', req.body);
    res.sendStatus(204);
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

then you need to make a local tunnel:
something like this
lt --port 8080 -s teammate123
Public URL example:
https://teammate123.loca.lt/ticketwebhookjson

üñêÔ∏è Usage with Postman

it is important that every where you use "url": "https://teammate123.loca.lt/ticketwebhookjson", it matches that same as in you javascript so if you call the app.post("/ticketwebhookjson", (req, res) somethine else you need to repalce it
